If possible create a new Database and user for blahz DNS.

Create DB:
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE BLAHZDNS;

Create User and grant them full priv to new DB;
GRANT ALL ON BLAHZDNS.* to username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEDGES;

Replacing username and password with your desired DB username and password.  Also if the DB host and Web server are on different machines change localhost with the hostname/IP of the webserver.

2) Load the base Blahz DNS Schema into the database.
From the untarred blahzdns directory.
mysql -u username -p BLAHZDNS < sql/schema.sql

This will load the base schema into the database.

3) Edit vars.php and Set the following 4 variables to their correct values

$dbhost
$dbuser
$dbpass
$dbname

4) Load up The following URL in a browser

http://servername/path/to/blahzdns/install.php

5) Follow the install steps.

5a) If you were using a previous version of BlahzDNS checkout the upgrade.py in
the scripts directory to automagically transfer primary & secondary zones, user accounts
and user zones associations from the previous version to the new version.

5b) If you changed your salt or crypt method from the previous version you will need to
reset all user account passwords.

6) Load up http://servername/path/to/blahzdns

7) Login with the username and password you created during the install.php steps.

8) Once you're sure everything is working delete the install.php file (or set it unreadable as it can be used to hose your blahzdns install)

9) Enter the Edit Configuration Screen to set the remainder of the system options.

10) Check the outputInterfaces directory for the script to output data into the correct
format for your DNS server package. If you do not wish to use the provided
output interfaces please feel free to write your own.  All I ask is that you submit it to
be included in the package. Once you have chosen a output Interface to use you
can either run it manually when you make a change.  Or you can set it up to run
in cron on an interval.
